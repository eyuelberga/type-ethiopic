> Type Ethiopic scripts in web and hybrid apps

This project intends to solve problems that developers face when trying to add support for typing Ge'ez based texts on web and hybrid applications using standard keyboard.

`type-ethiopic` provides an easy-to-use API for adding typing capabilities for HTML input and textarea elements with multiple configurable keyboard layouts. It can also be extended easily to support different use-cases.
