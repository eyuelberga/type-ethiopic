# Creating your own layout

layout definition files are simple json objects. They map keyboard input characters
to special values. It is possible to manually write a layout definition that will work with Type Ethiopic,
but we provide a package that can help you with this.

You can write layout definitions in a `.csv` file format and the
`@type-ethiopic/layout-generator` package will generate the layout for you.
